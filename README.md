# Text-Analysis-with-Hadoop
Hadoop, Python, Text Analysis, PySpark

### This is another online course I completed. I've learned about:

* The big idea of Map/Reduce
* How to design, implement, and execute tasks in the map/reduce framework. 
* Trade-offs in map/reduce and how that motivates other tools.
* Main design goals of HDFS, the read/write process to HDFS, main configuration parameters that can be tuned to control HDFS performance and robustness. 
* Get an overview of the different ways accessing data on HDFS.
* Apache Spark cluster computing framework.
* Python analysis pipeline with Spark

----------

I completed the tasks of:

* Run wordcount with Hadoop streaming, using Python code;
* Setup PySpark on the Cloudera VM and run simple join in Spark;
* Advance join in Spark
